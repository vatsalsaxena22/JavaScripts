# JavaScript:                  

The go-to scripting language for creating dynamic and interactive web applications. It’s everywhere—front-end, back-end, you name it.

# TypeScript:

A superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing. It’s ideal for larger, more complex projects where catching errors early is a big win. Plus, it compiles down to regular JavaScript.

# Node.js:

A runtime environment that allows you to execute JavaScript server-side. Perfect for building scalable network applications and APIs. It’s all about non-blocking, event-driven architecture.

# Deno: 

A modern runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript created by the original developer of Node.js.. It’s secure by default, ships with TypeScript support out of the box, and has no package manager—it uses URLs to import modules instead. A refreshing take on server-side JavaScript.
